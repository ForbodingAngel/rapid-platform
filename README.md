Rapid Platform
==============

Rapid Platform is a streamlined approach for building websites/webapps and rapid prototyping. It's a plugin for WordPress (a content management system). Built from scratch with responsive web design principles and best practices at it's core.

A fluid grid based on percentages, with columns that automatically stack vertically for smartphones. It's one of the easiest grid systems to use; Rapid Platform can build a four column responsive grid with the following shortcodes: 

  [rp_grid count="4" span="1"]html_content_goes_here[/rp_grid]
  [rp_grid count="4" span="1"]html_content_goes_here[/rp_grid]
  [rp_grid count="4" span="1"]html_content_goes_here[/rp_grid]
  [rp_grid count="4" span="1"]html_content_goes_here[/rp_grid]
  
A robust set of UI controls and components ready to drop into a page:

Oauth/OpenID Login, Lightbox Popups, Buttons, Tabs, Sliders, Web Fonts, Glyph Icons, etc.
