Rapid Platform  
==============  
  
Rapid Platform is a streamlined approach for building websites/webapps and rapid prototyping. It's a plugin for WordPress (a content management system). Built from scratch with responsive web design principles and best practices at it's core.  

A fluid grid based on percentages, with columns that automatically stack vertically for smartphones. It's one of the easiest grid systems to use; Rapid Platform can build a four column responsive grid with the following shortcodes:  

    [rp_grid count="4" span="1"]html_content_goes_here[/rp_grid]  
    [rp_grid count="4" span="1"]html_content_goes_here[/rp_grid]  
    [rp_grid count="4" span="1"]html_content_goes_here[/rp_grid]  
    [rp_grid count="4" span="1"]html_content_goes_here[/rp_grid]  
  
A robust set of UI controls and components ready to drop into a page:  
  
Oauth/OpenID Login (Google/Facebook/Yahoo/MyOpenID), Lightbox Popups, Buttons, Tabs, Sliders, Google Web Fonts, Glyph Icons, etc:  

    [rp_login_form]  
    [rp_lightbox]  
    [rp_button]  
    [rp_choice type="tabs"]  
    <p style="font-family:Open Sans;">...</p>  
    <span class="icon-download">Download</span>
